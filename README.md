App developed using C++ with the SFML library for graphics and OOP techniques for optimization and code reusability. It features a fully functional chessboard with all the rules implemented, offering three game modes: Player vs Player, Bot vs Player, and Bot vs Bot. The application is still in development and lacks some features, such as selecting a timer or enabling game replay. It incorporates various sophisticated algorithms for optimizing move searches, including the minimax algorithm, alpha-beta pruning, and one devised by me, which attempts to predict the best move based on piece value. The program can reach a depth of 10 moves in under a second in most cases.
